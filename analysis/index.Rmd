Welcome to the rank conditional coverage wimulations and examples website! Here you will find walkthroughs of all the simulations presented in [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06986) and some useful tips for running the package. The R package rcc can be installed from CRAN using 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rcc")
```

To run the simuations, we use a package `rccSims` that we wrote especially for this purpose. It can be installed using

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_git("https://github.com/jean997/rccSims.git")
```
