Version: 0.1.0
Author: Jean Morrison
Maintainer: Jean Morrison <jeanm@uchicago.edu>
Description: This package and its vignettes can be used to replicate the simulations found in "Rank conditional coverage and confidence intervals in high dimensional problems" by Jean Morrison and Noah Simon. There are three sets of simulations: the example in Section 1.5, linear regression simulations in 3.1 and biomarker simulations in 3.2. This package comes with three vignettes that walkthrough each of these simulations.
