Description: Replicate the simulations found in "Rank conditional coverage and confidence 
    intervals in high dimensional problems" by Jean Morrison and Noah Simon. 
    There are three sets of simulations: the example in Section 1.5, 
    linear regression simulations in 3.1 and biomarker simulations in 3.2. 
    This package comes with three vignettes that walkthrough each of these simulations.
